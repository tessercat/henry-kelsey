Came up with them Six tents of w^ch^, they kill'd\
This ill news kept secrett was from me\
Nor none of those home Indians did I see\
Untill that they their murder all had done\
And the Chief acter was he y^ts^ called y^e^ Sun\
So far I have spoken concerning of the spoil\
And now will give acco^t^. of that same Country soile\
Which hither part is very thick of wood\
Affords small nutts w^th^ little cherryes very good\
Thus it continues till you leave y^e^ woods behind\
And then you have beast of severall kind\
The one is a black a Buffillo great\
Another is an 'outgrown' Bear w^ch^ is good meat\
His skin to gett I have used all y^e^ ~~means~~ ways I can\
He is mans food & he makes food of man\
His hide they would not me it preserve\
But said it was a god & they should Starve\
This plain affords nothing but Beast & grass\
And over it in three days time we past\
getting unto y^e^ woods on the other side\
It being about forty sixe miles wide\
This wood is poplo ridges with small ponds of water\
there is beavour in abundance but no Otter\
with plains & ridges in the Country throughout\
Their Enemies many whom they cannot rout\
But now of late they hunt their Enemies\
And with our English guns do make y^m^, flie\
At deerings point after the frost\
I set up their a Certain Cross\
In token of my being ~~their~~ there\
Cut out on it y^e^ date of year\
And Likewise for to veryfie the same\
added to it my master sir Edward deerings name\
So having not more to trouble you w^th^ all I am\
Sir your most obedient & faithfull Serv^t^. at Command
