Hon^ble^.\
S^rs^.

I return you humble thanks for y^e^ Lett^r^ you sent me subscrib'd\
y^e^ 28 of may & having this oppertunity send this to acquaint\
you y^t^ y^e^ Gov^r^ has used all means y^t^ may be to encourage\
y^e^ ottaways & oth^r^. Indians to come down & has caused\
me to make speeches to y^m^ all y^t^ here would come\
brandy & oth goods plenty this against their\
coming & do not doubt but here may be a good\
trade next year if y^e^ french setting at severn\
this sumer does not hinder it y^e^ Gov^r^ also has\
sent to y^e^ E^t^ main this sum^mr^ but great part\
of y^e^ Indians were gone before we came by\
reason y^e^ breaking up of y^e^ river hove our ship\
on y^e^ bank of bayleys Iland so y^t^ great part\
of y^e^ summ^r^. was spent in getting her of & now\
is sending me to y^e^ E^t^main master of y^e^ ship &\
factory w^ch^ trust I shall discharge to y^e^ utmost\
of my Endeav^rs^. to increase y^e^ trade of small furs ~~or~~ or\
any oth^r^ Commoditie y^t^ may ad to your interest &\
Likewise to y^e^ saving of w^t^ provision I can Hon^ble^.\
Sirs I was desirous to winter at Slude river but y^e^\
Gov^r^ & council did not think it fitting by reason \
none is aquainted w^th^ y^e^ breaking up so it is defer'd till\
next year by w^ch^ time I shall be able to give your\
Hon^rs^. a bett^r^. acco^t^. & hope you will be please to\
consider my supplying of 2 mens place to ad ten\
pound to my sala^r^y as a gratitude if I do well & do\
believe y^e^ want of a Continual settlement is y^e^\
loss of y^t^ trade
