Sept^r^. y^e^ 10^th^\
This day setting.out again my strangers told me they would\
go before & give an acco^t^ y^t^ I was coming because they could make\
better way to their tents then I could so we travell'd till night &\
came to dist 20 Miles

Sept^r^. y^e^ 11^th^\
Now setting forward again about noon came up w^th^ their track\
& in y^e^ Evening came too altogether they being in number 11 tents\
our Journey not Extending 16 Miles

Sept^r^. y^e^ 12^th^\
This morning â€œhaving no victuals to invite y^e^ cap^t^. to so I filled\
y^t^ pipe w^ch^ y^e^ Govern^r^. had sent me w^th^ tobacco & then sent for y^e^ Cap^t^.\
So then I made a speech to him & told him y^t^ he should not mind\
w^t^ had passed formerly as concerning y^e^ nayhaythaways killing\
Six tents of his Country men & for y^e^ future we English will\
seek for to prevent it going any further for if so be they\
did so any more y^e^ Govern^r^. says he will not trade w^th^ y^m^\
if they did not cease from killing his friends & when I\
had done I presented him w^th^ present coat & sash Cup &\
one of my guns w^th^ knives awls & tobacco w^th^ small quantities\
of powder & shott & part of all such things as y^e^ Govern^r^.\
had sent me so he seemed to be very well pleased & told me\
he had forgott w^t^ had past altough they had kill'd most of\
his kindred & relations & likewise told me he was sorry he\
had not wherewithall for to make me Restitution for w^t^\
I had given him but he would meet me at Deerings point\
y^e^ next spring & go w^th^ me to y^e^ factory but it happened in\
the winter after I had parted w^th^ them y^e^ Nayhaythaways\
came up w^th^ y^m^ & killed two of y^m^ w^ch^ struck a new fear into\
y^m^ y^t^ they would not venture down fearing lest y^e^ home\
Indians would not let y^m^ up again into their own Country so\
when I was at Deerings point in the spring w^ch^ is y^e^ place\
of resortance when they are coming down to trade upon\
y^e^ arrival of some indians I had news brought me y^t^ y^e^ ~~\* \* \* \*~~ Cap^t^.\
afores^d^. had sent me a pipe & steam of his own making & withall\
y^e^ news of their being kill'd as I have spoken of before\
yet if so be I would send him a piece of tobacco from y^e^ factory\
upon y^e^ return of y^e^ same indians he would certainly come\
down y^e^ next year But if not y^e^ beavour in their Cuntry are\
unnumerable & will certainly be brought down every year\
so having not to inlarge sir I remain your obedient\
& faithfull

Serv^t^.
