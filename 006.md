gone before hopeing for to gett some relief of them\
by Estimation 25 Miles

July y^e^ 23^d^\
Now about noon one Indian returnâ€™d back\
fearing lest y^e^ women would starve w^ch^ were behind\
so I gave him some powder & an Order to receive\
some shott of such a woman so I proceeded\
forward along w^th^ a little slave Boy & toward\
night we came to good footing for all y^t^ we had\
passed before was heavy mossy going so in the\
Evening wee came too dist 30 Mile & nothing to eat\
but one wood patridge

July y^e^ 24^th^\
To day we had very good going & about noon we\
came up w^th^ their tents they had left to day they having\
increas'd from 2 to 7 & their fire not being quite\
out we sat down & roasted 3 Piggons w^ch^ I had kill'd\
y^t^ morning & so went along again till about six in y^e^\
afternoon we came to their tents they having\
nothing but grass & Berryes to eat part of w^ch^ they\
gave to me but at night they're people returning\
from hunting one had kill'd 2 Swans & another had\
kill'd a Buck Muse but did not come home till in\
y^e^ Night so I being asleep he sent his son to call me\
& when he came he told me y^t^ his father wanted me\
to come & smoke a pipe with him so I went & when\
I came he gave me a pipe to light & then presented\
me w^th^ the great gut of y^e^ Beast afore^sd^, so when I had\
Eaten I returned to my rest having travelled to day\
20 Miles 

July y^e^ 25^th^\
This morning I made a speech desireing y^m^ for to\
stay for our people w^ch^ was behind but an Old\
man came to me & told me y^t^ it would signify nothing\
for to lye still seeing y^t^ there was no victuals to\
Relieve y^m^ when they came up so desired leave of\
me to pitch a little way y^t^ y^e^ women might fetch\
home y^e^ Beast w^ch^ was kill'd y^e^ day before y^t^ they\
might have wherewithall to relieve y^m^ when they\
came so I sent two women back for to help our\
women along w^th^ their their so we pitched\
about 10 Miles & came too
