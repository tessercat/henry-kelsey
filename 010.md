August y^e^ 15^th^\
This Instant one Indian Lying a dying & withall\
a murmuring w^ch^ was amongst the Indians Because\
I would not agree for y^m^ to go to warrs so I taking it\
into Consideration cut some tobacco & call'd all y^e^\
Old dons to my tent telling y^m^ y^t^ it was not y^e^ way\
for y^m^ to have the use of English guns & other things\
& y^t^ I nor they should not go near y^e^ Govern^r^. unless\
they ceast from warring so lay still to day

August y^e^ 16^th^\
Now not knowing w^ch^ would Conquer life or Death\
lay still to day our people going a hunting but\
had small success

August y^e^ 17^th^\
Last night death ceased & this morning his body\
was burned according to their way they making A\
great feast for him y^t^ did it now after y^t^ y^e^ flesh\
was burned his Bones were taken & buried w^th^ Loggs\
set up rou^n^d of about ten foot Long so we pitcht to\
day near 14 Miles & came to they holding it not good\
to stay by y^e^ Dead

August y^e^ 18^th^\
This day I sent two Indians for to seek for those\
w^ch^ I had sent before to see for y^e^ Mountain poets\
fearing lest they should have come to any damage\
being so long absent so we pitched y^e^ ground\
Continuing as formerly dist 8 Miles

August y^e^ 19^th^\
Now we sett forward again y^e^ ground being more\
Barren then it use to be y^e^ Indians having seen\
great store of Buffillo But kill'd none by Estimat\

August y^e^ 20^th^\
To day we pitcht to y^e^ outtermost Edge of y^e^ woods\
this plain affords Nothing but short Round\
sticky grass & Buffillo & a great ~~sor~~ sort of a Bear w^ch^\
is Bigger then any white Bear & is Neither White\
nor Black But silver hair'd like our English\

Northward their Horns growing like an English\
