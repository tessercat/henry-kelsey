August y^e^ 21^st^\
This day we lay Expecting a post from y^e^ mountaine\
poets but none came

August y^e^ 22^d^\
Now we pitched into the barren ground it being very\
dry heathy land & no water but here & there a small\
pond so we came to but could not see y^e^ woods on y^e^\
other side dist 16 Miles

August y^e^ 23^d^\
This Instant y^e^ Indians going a hunting Kill'd\
great store of Buffillo Now y^e^ manner of their hunting\
these Beast on y^e^ Barren ground is when they see a great\
parcel of them together they surround them w^th^ men w^ch^ done\
they gather themselves into a smaller Compass Keeping\
y^e^ Beast still in y^e^ middle & so shooting y^m^ till they\
break out at some place or other & so gett away from\
y^m^ our women Likewise pitching according to order\
dist 12 Miles

August y^e^ 24^th^\
This day lay still waiting for a post w^ch^ came in y^e^ afternoon\
from y^e^ Capt: of the Mountain Poets Named Washa\
so y^e^ Substance of their news was y^t^ he desired we would\
meet him when we pitcht again so I told y^t^ I would

August y^e^ 25^th^\
So pitching again we came to altogether & in number we\
were 80 Tents we having travelled to day by Estimation\
12 Miles yet not reacht y^e^ woods on y^e^ other side this plain\
running through great part of y^e^ Country & lyeth along\
near East & west

August y^e^ 26^th^\
Now we are altogether they made a feast y^e^ which they\
Invited me to so they desired leave of me for y^m^ to go to wars but\
I told y^m^ y^t^ I could not grant y^m^ their request for y^e^ Govern^r^. would\
not allow me so to do so we lay still to day

August y^e^ 27^th^\
To day we pitched again & got to y^e^ woods on y^e^ other side y^e^\
Plain being about 46 miles over our Journey not Extending\
6 miles

August y^e^ 28^th^\
This day we lay still y^e^ Indians being willing for to go hunt\
Buffillo because there is none of these Beast in y^e^ woods so\
I condescended to it so I called six Indians & fitted y^m^ out w^th^\
tobacco & powder & shott & bid y^m^ go seek for some Naywatame\
poets & if so be y^t^ they found y^m^ I would Reward y^m^ sufficiently
