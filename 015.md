## Indians Belief and Superstitions

Now I shall according to y^e^ best of my knowledge give\
an Acco^t^. of those Indians belief & Superstitions in their\
ways & how they make use of them

Their first & Chiefest point is A piece of Birch\
rine full of Feathers of Divers sorts put on a piece\
of Leather w^ch^ is broad at one End for to tie about their\
head at such a sort y^t^ y^e^ remaining part shall hang\
down over their back this they put to use when their\
Enemies are in sight believing y^t^ it will save y^m^ from\
being kill'd. It being not y^e^ work of their own hands\
But of their father or some other old man near kin to\
y^m^ This thing is called by their name Wessguaniconan\
w^ch^ in time of use is accompanied w^th^ songs made by y^e^\
same man w^ch^ made y^e^ other w^ch^ songs are Called Wonny\
seewahiggens so much for the first point

Their second point is Concerning A pipe steam\
done w^th^ feathers of Divers sorts & near y^t^ end w^ch^ goeth\
into y^e^ mouth is three voulter or Eagles feathers split &\
lay'd on like y^e^ feathers of an arrow Now every one of\
these & all things Else belonging to the steam Afore^sd^.\
hath a speech belongs to every one of y^m^ as y^e^ makers\
fancy leads him Now there is but very few Indians\
but w^t^ are beading Indians y^t^ can get one of these pipes\
& when he hath a mind to go to warrs or any other\
way he calls all of y^m^ together & tells y^m^ his mind so\
then he Lights his pipe & serveth y^m^ Round Crying\
Now their Custom is to take but four Whiffs of\
those pipes & if any one hath not a mind to go w^th^ him\
nor answer his request he will Likewise refuse to\
smoke out of his pipe & again if any man hath made\
use of a woman y^e^ last night or his wife be w^th^ Child\
he will pass by the pipe & give thanks if he has a\
Mind to go w^th^ him for they think they shall adulter\
ate y^e^ pipe if they should smoke out of it at such\
a time Likewise they will send these pipes out upon\
any expedition as when they go for to seek out their\
Enemies tracks or when y^t^ they are in want of\
victuals they will fitt a young man out w^th^ a pipe\
steam & if it happens y^t^ it fulfills w^t^ they design then\
it doth pass for a true god Ever afterwards although it\
hath been never so false before
