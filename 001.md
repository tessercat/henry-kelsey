Henry Kelsey his Book being y^e^ Gift of James\
Hubbud in the year of our Lord 1693\

Now Reader Read for I am well assur'd\
Thou dost not know the hardships I endur'd\
In this same desert where Ever y^t^ I have been\
Nor wilt thou me believe without y^t^ thou had seen\
The Emynent Dangers that did often me attend\
But still I lived in hopes y^t^ once it would amend\
And makes me free from hunger & from Cold\
Likewise many other things w^ch^ I cannot here unfold\
For many times I have often been oppresst\
With fears & Cares y^t^ I could not take my rest\
Because I was alone & no friend could find\
And once y^t^ in my travels I was left behind\
Which struck fear & terror into me\
But still I was resolved this same Country for to see\
Although through many dangers I did pass\
Hoped still to undergo y^m^, at the Last\
Now Considering y^t^ it was my dismal fate\
for to repent I thought it now to late\
Trusting still unto my masters Consideration\
Hoping they will Except of this my small Relation\
Which here I have pend & still will Justifie\
Concerning of those Indians & their Country\
If this wont do farewell to all as I may say
