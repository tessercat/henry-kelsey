To day we lay still having strangers come to\
our tents from some stone Indians w^ch^ was to y^e^\

strangers & provided them something to Eat &\
some Tobacco for to smoak it so they told us\
their news w^ch^ was y^t^ y^e^ Nayhaythaways had\
lost 3 of their women w^ch^ y^e^ Naywattame poets had\
killed y^e^ last spring & withall they appointed where\
they themselves would meet us but as for y^e^ Naywattame\
poets they were fled so far y^t^ they thought I should\
not see them

August y^e^ 5^th^\
Now we pitched again our strangers Likewise\
Returning to their tents I telling y^m^ if by any means\

Indians for to give y^m^ all y^e^ Encouragements\
