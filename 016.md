The next point being their third is when they are in want\
of any thing but victuals especially in y^e^ night they will\
cause y^e^ tent to be made Close & y^e^ fire to thrown out of\
doors Likewise y^e^ women must be absent so all things\
being dark & husht one of y^e^ Indians will begin to make\
a speech w^ch^ Endeded he will fall a singing till such\
time he thinks he has pleasured y^e^ Company & then\
will begin for to Whistle Making his fellows\
believe y^t^ he hath a familiar they believing it to\
be so to so by y^t^ means he will answer y^m^ to any ques\
tion they shall ask him & will tell y^m^ w^ch^ way they ~~sha~~\
shall go to look for victuals or to find other indians\
& this y^e^ Natives holds for truth but I have found it\
often to be lyes

Now their fourth point is if any of y^m^ be sick they\
use no other means nor know no other help but to\
sing to y^e^ sick for w^ch^ purpose they hire a man & he\
calls together some men more or less for to accompa\
nie him in his singing so all of y^m^ getting a piece\
of birch Rine & a little stick goes to the sick mans tent\
then he y^ts^ hired begins to sing & y^e^ Rest Beats upon y^e^\
Rine y^e^ same stroke he uses w^th^ his rattle w^ch^ is made of\
Birch rine hallow within having some stones or\
Beads Inclosed in it so when he has sat & sung a\
while to his patient he y^ts^ hired will rise up stark\
naked making a hideous noise & having there\
ready a Dish of Cold water takes a mouthfull\
of it & spurts on y^e^ sick person so following\
it Close w^th^ his mouth sucks at his skin &\
Rising from him again halls drugs or something\
out of his mouth so makes his fellows believe he\
suckt it out of y^e^ sick person, & indeed is hard to be\
perceiv'd to y^e^ Contrary Now in such times they\
will take y^e^ best things they have & hang upon
