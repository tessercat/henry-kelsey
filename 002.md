As for my living i'll seek some other way\
In sixteen hundred & ninety'th year\
I set forth as plainly may appear\
Through Gods assistance for to understand\
The natives language & to see their land\
And for my masters interest I did soon\
Sett from y^e^ house y^e^ twealth of June\
Then up y^e^ River I with heavy heart\
Did take my way & from all English part\
To live amongst y^e^ Natives of this place\
If god permits me for one two years space\
The Inland Country of Good report hath been\
By Indians but by English yet not seen\
Therefore I on my Journey did not stay\
But making all y^e^ hast i could upon our way\
Gott on y^e^ borders of y^e^ stone Indian Country\
I took possession on y^e^ tenth Instant July\
And for my masters I speaking for y^m^, all\
This neck of land I deerings point did call\
Distance from hence by Judgement at y^e^ lest\
From y^e^ house six hundred miles southwest\
Through Rivers w^ch^ run strong with falls\
thirty three Carriages five lakes in all\
The ground begins for to be dry with wood\
Poplo & birch with ash thats very good\
For the Natives of that place w^ch^, knows\
No use of Better than their wooden Bows\
According to y^e^ use & custom of this place\
In September I brought those Natives to a peace\
But I had no sooner from those Natives turnd my back\
Some of the home Indians came upon their track\
And for old grudges & their minds to fill
