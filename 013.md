Sept^r^. y^e^ 4^th^\
To day I sent two Indians back for to tell our people for\
to make w^t^ hast they could to me I tarrying ~~for to~~ there my\
self for to hear w^t^ News some ~~some~~ young men brought w^ch^ went\
from thence three days before I came for to look for their Enemies

Sept^r^. y^e^ 5^th^\
About ten o Clock this morning y^e^ young men appearing in sight &\
crying out ^Just^ like a Crane w^ch^ gave a sign y^t^ they had discovered their\
Enemies & as soon as they came within one hundred yards of y^e^ tent they\
~~Enem~~ sat all down in a Row upon the grass not speaking one word so y^e^ old\
Men lighting their pipes went to y^m^ & served y^m^ round Crying as\
if they had been stob'd for Joy they had found their enemies y^e^\
young men having brought some old arrows to verifie w^t^ they\
had been about

Sept^r^ y^e^ 6^th^\
This Instant I unclosed y^e^ pipe w^ch^ y^e^ governour had sent me\
telling y^m^ y^t^ they must Imploy their time in Catching of beav\
our for y^t^ will be better liked on then their killing their Enem\
ies when they come to y^e^ factory neither was I sent there for\
to kill any Indians but to make peace w^th^ as many as I could\
but all my arguments prevailed nothing w^th^ y^m^ for they told me\
w^t^ signified a peace w^th^ those Indians considering they knew not\
y^e^ use of Cannoes & were resolved to go to wars so I seeing it in vain I\
held my peace

Sept^r^. y^e^ 7^th^\
This day we pitcht again & got through y^e^ woods this ledge not\
being above 30 Miles through but we made it a great deal more by reason\
we kept in it for to hunt beavour & to come altogether\
this plain being in y^e^ same Nature of y^e^ other w^ch^ we had past before\
our Journey not Extending 10 Miles

Sept^r^. y^e^ 8^th^\
Now likewise we pitched again & by y^e^ way met w^th^ those Indians w^ch^\
I came post from & so came too altogether this afternoon came four\
Indian strangers from those w^ch^ are called Naywatame po^e^ts y^e^ w^ch^\
I receiv'd very kindly & made much of y^m^ Likewise our own people\
returning w^th^ y^m^ so I inquired where there Cap^t^. was they giving me\
an acco^t^. y^t^ he was two days Journey behind our Journey to day\
not Extending 8 Miles

Sept^r^. y^e^ 9^th^\
This morning I went to y^e^ Cap^t^. of y^e^ stone Indians tent carry\
ing w^th^ me a piece of tobacco I telling him to make a speech to all\
his Country men & tell y^m^ not to disturbe nor meddle w^th^ y^e^\
Naywattame poets for I was going back to Invite & incourage\
y^m^ to a peace once more so they all gave their Consent & told me\
y^t^ they were very free to have y^m^ to be their friends so I took my\
way back along w^th^ those w^ch^ came yesterday having 12 tents along\
